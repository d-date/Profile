I've developing iOS apps for 6 years since I was student, the Steve Jobs still alive.

I've making for Customer, such as the app searching recipes with words, the app making greeding cards using photo in your mobile and printing out and post it.

I'm not only the developer, but also the marketer.
After releasing app, I've watching user's interests and growth up by marketing analytics, such as push notification, email, or something events on app.

To making good app for user, I'm trying not to forget the eye's of user.
